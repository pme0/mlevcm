\title{\code{mlevcm}: ML-based Epidemiological Vector Control Monitoring using
FDA techniques for NIRS data}
\description{
The \code{mlevcm} package provides functions to train and test machine
learning models capable of predicting characteristics of epidemiological
interest of disease vectors (e.g., mosquitoes) such as age, species and
infectiousness from near-infrared spectra.
